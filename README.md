## Insights & Recommendations
-	There were 34 attendees ranging from 27 to 86 years old. 
Gather feedback by age group to refine the program and cater to diverse needs, boosting satisfaction and engagement.

-	More men showed interest, indicating active health management. 
To encourage female attendance, focus on women’s health topics and highlight female support to make them feel comfortable.

-	Zip codes provide insight into participants' locations. 
Use this data to send targeted follow-ups and health resources relevant to their regions.

-	Tailor the program based on attendees' interests to boost engagement. 
Incorporate interactive elements like discussions or activities that align with their preferences.


## Limitations & Potential Solutions

- The small sample size (34 attendees) may not fully represent all age groups, potentially skewing feedback and limiting insights.
Analyse a larger number of participants to ensure a more representative sample across age groups.

- Zip codes may not fully capture the diversity within regions, as they don't account for specific local issues.
Complement zip code data with additional demographic or community insights, such as local health trends or needs.

- If follow-ups are not personalised, engagement may drop. 
Use zip code data and feedback to send tailored health resources and event invites, ensuring relevance for each participant.

## Summary

There were 34 attendees, aged 27 to 86. Gathering feedback by age group can help refine the program to meet diverse needs. More men attended, so focusing on women’s health topics and providing female support can encourage female participation. Zip code data offers insights into locations, allowing for targeted follow-ups and region-specific resources. Tailoring the program to attendees’ interests, with interactive elements like discussions or activities, can increase engagement.
